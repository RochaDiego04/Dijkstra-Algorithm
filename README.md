# Dijkstra Algorithm

## Introduction
In this project we will be implementing Dijkstra's algorythm, it will be running in the file "main.py".
The user can add the start point in a grid and the end point, so the algorythm will draw the best path between these points.
There are 2 backend NON-VISUAL implementations for Dijkstra's algorythm, just to show how the algorythm works.

## How to use
LEFT CLICK: To set the start or end node in the grid.
RIGHT CLICK: To set barreers for which the algorithm cannot search.
Once the start and end node are set, the user can press the Start Dijkstra Search button.
The user can restart the grid by pressing the restart button.

## Instalation
This project was implemented in Python, using Tkinter for the graphic interface.
