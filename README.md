# Dijkstra Algorithm

## Introduction
In this project we will be implementing Dijkstra's algorithm, which can be found in the file `Dijkstra_Visual.py`. The algorithm allows users to set a start point and an end point on a grid, and it will calculate the best path between these points. We have also included two non-visual backend implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm to showcase how the algorithm works.

## How to Use
- **LEFT CLICK**: Use the left mouse button to set the start or end node on the grid.
- **RIGHT CLICK**: Use the right mouse button to set barriers that the algorithm cannot search.
- Once the start and end nodes are set, you can press the "Start Dijkstra Search" button to begin the search.
- You can restart the grid by pressing the restart button.

## Installation
This project was implemented in Python and requires Tkinter for the graphical interface.

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/RochaDiego04/Dijkstra-Algorithm.git

2. Ensure that you have Python and Tkinter installed on your system before running the project.
